# Wireless-Link-Quality-Prediction

## Data processing for Cooja file
- Replace the spaces by ;
- Change ID:x to m3-x (e.g., x in {95,96,97,98,102})

## Observations
- The differences between the number of send packets in experimental and simulation data are due to the fact that for some reason, some nodes stop sending for a given period (e.g., m3-11 stops sending between 10min and 15min approximately)
